//JavaScript is a dynamic language and not static, which means that variables can hold values of different types during runtime.Unlike languages such as Typescript or Java, you donâ€™t need to declare the data type of a variable explicitly.

//1_premitive type (call by value )
//type of 7:-  string ,Number ,Boolean,null, undefined,BigInt,symbol

const myName="shaily"
const myNumber =1234
const myBooleanvalue = false
const value = null
let game ;
 const bigNumber =12345678901111n

 const id= Symbol('1234')
 const anotherId =Symbol('1234')

 console.log(id===anotherId);

//2_Non-preanitive(call by Reference)
//type of :- Arrays ,obejects,Functions 

const mySuperheroname= ["myfamily","myfriends", "myteachers"];

let myobject ={
    Id :"2345",
    Branchname : "IT",
    city : "Delhi"

}

const myFunction = function(){

    console.log("this is javascript");

}

//all typeof
console.log(typeof id);
console.log(typeof myFunction);
console.log(typeof myobject);
